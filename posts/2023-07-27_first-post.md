# This is my first post!

tbh, I really just needed to have something here to test my css (the verdict: bad.)

uhh

in the future, you can expect:

* LinuxConvert devlogs (& a recap of what's happened so far this by this weekend)

* random philosophical ramblings, probably

* tutorials, because when i'm in a productive mood, the [Feynman technique](https://todoist.com/inspiration/feynman-technique) really works

* resources and explanations for things i've built

* project postmortems

...

is that enough?

good.
