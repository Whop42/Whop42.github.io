# This is my first post!

tbh, I really just needed to have something here to test my css (the verdict: bad.)

uhh

in the future, you can expect:

* LinuxConvert devlogs (& a recap of what's happened so far this by this weekend)
* random philosophical ramblings, probably
* tutorials on random things i've learned about (likely some CTF/RevEng stuff soon)
* resources and explanations for things i've built
* project postmortems

...

is that enough?

good.
